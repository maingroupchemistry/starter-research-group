Hello! We are a research group currently located at the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry at Heidelberg University were we are pursuing our interests in main group chemistry. The activation of elements of the p-block for interesting new chemistry and catalysis by strong ligand effects is at the heart of our research. Our experimental efforts are always supported using state-of-the-art computational methods to help us understand and predict new reactivity.
